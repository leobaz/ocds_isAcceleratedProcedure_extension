# Accelerated procedure

The minimum time period between the publication of a tender notice and the deadline for accepting bids. If the period is the same or longer than the minimun, then the deadline is 'normal' and we express it with 'true', if it is shorter than the minimum, it is 'shortened' and we express it with 'false'.


## Example
```
{
  "procedure": {
    "isAcceleratedProcedure": true
  }
}

```
